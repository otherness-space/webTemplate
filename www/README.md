# This is the folder of the web hierarchy.

# The purpose of this document is to write and sketch reflectively about web development and information delivery or data visualization.

# What if the interweb was a geography of a cacophony of story tellers?

# What is the purpose of each story?

# If the purpose of each story is to engage and enchant, what is the journey once that happens?

# If the journey is persuasion, what is the most delightful way to achieve that goal?

# If the persuasion is to sell and the goal is for the user to buy, how does that happen the most mindfully?

# If the persuasion is to teach and the goal is for the user to learn, how does that happen the most mindfully?

# What if the vision is cultural change? How does persuasion become smooth and sophisticated to change culture?

# If social media is about joining the conversation and how does one join the conversation in a compelling way?

# How is the rhetoric of silence more effective than more information?

# What is silence as a metaphor? How does silence compare with serenity?

# What is the ethos of silence?

# How does passion locate in silence?

# What is the logic of silence?

# What if information design on the web was framed as information design for public spaces? How would it be more or less effective?

# I feel more engaged by web development, as a former union carpenter, than I am by web design. I might say that I just need more practice in an attempt to gloss over my preference but I have a great respect for designers because they see things that I do not. I, on the other hand, often find I see things designers do not. It is my perception that resolving structural design delivery issues in ways that smoothly execute the essence of intent is a compelling exercise.

# The following are some of my thoughts of what, in my experience that I gained from working with a small business web developer as well as on my own, I would speculate responsive web development would be able to address.

# I'm beginning to think of web delivery and presentation as a slideshow presentation.

# What I mean by a slideshow presentation is using the minimal amount of content to achieve the maximum understanding of the user in a way that is gentle on the eyes of the user. I feel to be gentle on the eyes of the user there needs to be a large amount of negative space that collaborates with options to increase the details of the content per the whim of the user.

# I am beginning to think of the details of the content as abstracts, handouts and appendices in presentation collateral and secondary literature. In my experience, it seems that too often large design shops are compelled by client vision to inundate the UX and UI with to much data which makes everything noisy.

# In web geography of today I feel there is too much noise pollution.

# The way my thoughts are moving it seems that the web may benefit from a reduction of the amount of noise pollution that users experiences.

# A seminal consideration of this type of thinking, that the web seems to be filled with noise pollution, is something I am clipping from critical theory.

# The way that I perceive this type of thinking may be understood as the theory of the rhetoric of silence.

# Moving this type of thinking along, it seems to me that social media most definitely needs input using tool sets of silence as rhetoric.

# Looking at the web in this way, I would want to frame this type of thinking as persuasion that is bookended by silence and negative space.

# I realize it is much more challenging to be concise and effective in persuading click throughs but I see this type of thought to be the expanse between the experience of Vegas and a Japanese tea garden.
